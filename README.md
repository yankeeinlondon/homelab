# Homelab

> Fancy things for fancy Homelabs

## Features

- type safe **Pihole v6 API**
- type safe **Proxmox API**
- Homelab inventory builder
- Pihole sync between 1:M servers

## Usage

This library can be imported as a ESM or CJS library but it also exposes a CLI as well.


## OS Support

This should work without issue on **macOS** and most **Linux** distros but I have not tested on **Windows**. There's nothing intrinsically preventing it from working on Windows but it wouldn't surprise me if there are some small configuration changes to get it to work on there.

If you're a Windows user and know Typescript, consider creating a PR?
